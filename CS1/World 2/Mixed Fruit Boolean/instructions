A merchant mainly sells cans of mixed fruit, containing papayas, bananas, and mangoes. 
To be as consistent as possible, the merchant wants to maintain a relatively consistent proportion of each 
fruit in any given can. Each can must have at least 10% papaya and at least half as much papaya as banana.

Suppose for a given can that the amount of papaya is "p", the amount of mango is "m", and the amount of 
banana is "b" (all floats). Write a Boolean expression that says whether the can should be sold. 
That is, use the variables above to create an expression that will result in true only if the makeup of a can can be sold.
