Your goal with this question is to practice writing your own function. You can only write your own functions in active mode, 
which is why we need to add draw() and setup() even though we aren't doing any animations or user interaction.

Make a function called happy() that has no parameters and has no return value (that is, the return type is of type void). 
The function should draw a happy face in the middle of the output window. Use the following setup() and draw() functions 
in your sketch and do not add any code to these two functions.  (You can, of course, change the background colour and/or 
the size of the window if you want to).

void setup()
{
  size(500, 350);
  background(14, 54, 8);
  smooth();
}

void draw()
{
  happy();
}



Note: do not spend a lot of time making the happy face look nice.  
That is not the point of this question.  
You can use arc(100,100,50,50,0,PI) to make a "happy" mouth.
