** QUESTION 1 ** 

Programmer Jane Doe is trying to draw a house. The picture below shows what she’s trying to create. 
But if you run her code in HouseDrawing  Download HouseDrawing, you can see it’s not working properly.
Your job is to use one of the visual debugging techniques introduced earlier to figure out what's going wrong. 
When you figure it out, fix the code, and write a comment above the line(s) of code you change, explaining what you did.


** QUESTION 2 ** 

Open your code from the Product Variants on a Shelf assignment.

Use the Debug mode in Processing to determine the x and y coordinates of the 10th and 20th products that are drawn on the shelf. 
(Don't just use a println; the purpose of the question is for you to get the hang of adding breakpoints and using the variables inspector).

Submit two screenshots of your program output and the variables inspector, one after the 10th product is drawn and one after the 
20th product is drawn. Highlight or circle the relevant product on the screenshot and its x and y coordinates in the variables inspector.
