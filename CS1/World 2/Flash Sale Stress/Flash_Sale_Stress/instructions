For this assignment, you will have a lot of creative freedom.  

Your goal is to make an interactive picture that represents how you, as a merchant, might react to the stress of an upcoming flash sale.  
Have fun with it!

Here are the requirements:

- Create a Processing sketch that includes, somewhere, a representation of the merchant character as part of a scene or on a background.

- The character needs to be sufficiently complex, consisting of at least 4 distinct components that can be made of shapes, images, etc.

- The sketch must react to a mouse click in at least two areas of the screen.  Some clear visual aspects of your sketch must change when the mouse is clicked. 
For example, something can grow, shrink, move, dance, change colour, etc…

- The reaction should be related to the character’s increasing stress as the flash sale draws nearer.  You are invited to interpret this any way you want.

- For one of the reactions, the number of clicks made in the same location should make a difference somehow to what happens.  
For example, perhaps clicking on the character’s face makes it increasingly red.
