** QUESTION 1 **

Draw a rectangle somewhere on the screen. Create a ball that moves in a straight horizontal line, 
ensuring that the ballâ€™s path will cross that of the rectangle. When the ball hits the rectangle, it should bounce
and start moving in the opposite direction. Similarly, if the ball hits the edge of the screen, it should bounce.




** QUESTION 2 **

Draw a circle in the output window. Your circle should be moving in some direction (other than horizontal or vertical) with a constant speed. 
When your circle hits a wall, it should bounce off of it in a realistic way and keep moving. For example, the two screenshots below show the 
bouncing ball after a few bounces and after many bounces (you don't have to leave a trail if you don't want to).

Hint: One way to make the ball bounce is to simply negate the value representing speed in the appropriate direction. 
For example, if bouncing off the top or bottom, you can negate the speed in the y-direction.




** QUESTION 3 **

Draw three boxes, each with a different colour, on the screen. Each box should have one letter (text) written inside the box, "A", "B" and "C".
When you press one of the keys a, b or c, the colour of the box with that letter in it should change to another colour. When you press the same 
key the colour of that box should return to its original colour.
