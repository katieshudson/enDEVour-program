** QUESTION 1 ** 

Fill the screen with small circles by placing them at random positions (one new circle each time draw() is called).  
Any circle that appears on the righthand side of the output window should be one colour and all circles on the lefthand 
side of the output window should be another colour.


** QUESTION 2 ** 

For this question you will draw a rectangle in the middle of the screen and change its colour according to mouse movement.

When the mouse moves from the background to the rectangle in the centre of the output window the colours should be swapped 
(the rectangle should be purple and the background should be yellow). When the mouse is not on the rectangle in the centre the 
colours should be the same as they originally were (the rectangle should be yellow and the background should be purple).  
Note that you do not have to click in order to change the colours.
