** INTRO ** 

You are a merchant that is hoping to sell digital art downloads. You want your buyers to be able to customize your art in various ways before downloading it. 
They will be able to adjust certain parameters, and then your code will generate the final image.

To test your idea, you are building a prototype based on Goldilocks and the Three Bears (Links to an external site.). 
For now, the main parameter that users can adjust is the height and width of the image.

In your prototype, you have to draw three bears that are spaced evenly across the width of the window, no matter what size the window is 
(within reason â€“ don't worry about when the window is smaller than the three bears are).  There should be the same amount of space between 
the bears as well as on either of side of the whole group of three.  The size of the bears does not have to change.

You will also draw Goldilocks above the three bears.  There should be an equal amount of space between the top edge of the window and Goldilocks, 
between Goldilocks and the bears, and the bears and the bottom edge of the window.

You can draw the bears and Goldilocks however you want as long as 
they are generally recognizable, but you need to have both a head and a body for both characters.

** QUESTION 1 ** 

(Submit your response to this question as a text and image file, or a PDF with everything, inside the zip with the code.)

Create a plan for how you will write a program to draw the image:

Write down the variable names you want to use in the sketch along with their data types.
Draw a diagram showing how you plan to draw the bears and Goldilocks. 
Label the important sizes and distances in the diagram as reference, using variable names instead of hardcoded values where appropriate.
(You can use a tool like Google Drawings (Links to an external site.) or upload a phone picture/scan of a drawing you make on paper.)
Explain conceptually how you are going to space the bears evenly apart across the window, 
optionally using mathematical formulas in your explanation if you find it helpful.
Explain how you can use a function to effectively abstract the drawing of each bear.


** QUESTION 2 ** 

Write code to implement the plan you laid out in Question 1.

These are the technical requirements you will need to fulfill:

A simple drawing of Goldilocks appears in the top half of the screen.
Goldilocks is exactly in the middle of the screen horizontally no matter the size of the window.
A simple drawing of the three bears appears in the bottom half of the screen.
There is a single function that can draw a bear at a given x, y location. This function is called three times to draw all the bears.
The space between the first and second bear is the same as the space between the second and third bear, 
which is the same as the space between the edges of the window and the first or last bear.
The space between the top of the window and Goldilocks is the same as the space between Goldilocks and the bears, 
which is the same as the space between the bears and the bottom of the screen.
