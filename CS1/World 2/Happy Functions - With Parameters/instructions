Remember your code from the Happy Functions assignment? 

Let's think of our happy() function as an abstraction. When we use the function, 
we want to know it will draw a happy face without caring how it's done. We're fairly close to being able to do this, 
with just one problem: we can only draw our happy face in one location right now.

Go get your code from the Happy Functions assignment.

Generalize the happy() function so that you can draw happy faces wherever you want.

Then, inside of draw(), call happy() several times such that the happy face shows up in a few different locations on the screen.
