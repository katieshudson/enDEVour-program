Draw a circle in the output window that moves to the right.  
The circle should have an initial position centred at the point (width/4, height/8).  
For example, below are 3 screenshots of the output window showing the initial circle, the moving circle some short time later, 
and then the circle after it has moved out of the output window.

Hints:

- Which of the three reasons for needing variables are you going to apply?
- What variables do you need? Put these at the top of the file before writing any functions.
- What needs to be done once and only once? Put that code into setup().
- You are going to be adding something new to the screen every time draw() is called. What is it? Call the appropriate shape function in draw().
- Additionally, there is something you need to update every time draw() is called. Perhaps one of your variables? 
- Think about how you can get your circle to change its position over time and make the change in draw().
