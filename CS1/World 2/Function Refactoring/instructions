We're going to try our hand at looking for patterns and abstracting code we are already given.

- Download the starter file  Download starter file.
- Look for patterns that you could generalize.
- Write one new function with whatever parameters you need to draw the shapes you see.
- Call the new function exactly three times from draw().

Now put your answer to the following as a comment in the top of your code file (you may wish to use multi-line comments 
Keep in mind that articulating your answers clearly, completely, and correctly is challenging, but an important part of the process of truly 
understanding the concepts.

Refer back to the review of functions and variables, particularly the section on functions as abstractions. We said that there were 
two sides of the abstraction coin: generalization, and hiding details. Explain how the new function you wrote above does each of these two things.
