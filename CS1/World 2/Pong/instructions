For this question, you are going to create a simple Pong game.

Here are the requirements:

A vertical white line is drawn down the centre of the screen.
A blue ball is drawn on the screen.
Two paddles are drawn on either side of the screen, similar to the green paddles shown above.
A score value is shown on the top left of the screen for the left player and on the top right side of the screen for the right player. 
Note that this is not currently shown on the image above.
Drawing code will be organized into self-contained functions that do not use any global variables except possibly as arguments 
when calling the function (recall that a global variable is one that is defined at the top of the file outside of any functions).

User interaction:
Pressing the ‘w’ key will cause the left paddle to move up.
Pressing the ‘s’ key will cause the left paddle to move down.
Pressing the ‘o’ key will cause the right paddle to move up.
Pressing the ‘k’ key will cause the right paddle to move down.
Neither paddle will ever be allowed to leave the window (that is, they will always be fully visible within the window).

Gameplay:
When the program runs, the ball will start moving left (probably at an angle).
When the ball hits a paddle or the top/bottom of the screen, it should bounce off in an appropriate direction. You may want to add a small amount of randomness here.
A score variable for each of the left and right players should be created to keep track of score.
When a player misses the ball, the other player’s score should increase and the ball should be returned to its starting position.
Want an extra challenge? Try programming a simple artificial intelligence for one of the players.
