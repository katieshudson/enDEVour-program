** QUESTION 1 ** 

Fill the screen with small circles by placing them at random() (Links to an external site) positions 
(one new circle each time draw() is called). You might like to experiment with the frameRate() for this question.


** QUESTION 2 **

For this question, you will implement a program with a little monster head that will jump to wherever you click on the screen.

First, write out the skeleton for your program: add empty setup() and draw() functions.

Add variables at the top to keep track of the following, marking only the variables that shouldn't change as final:

the head's x and y positions
the head's width, height
the background colour
the head colour
In setup(), set the window size and the starting position of the monster (the centre of the window works well). 
Also switch to CENTER mode for drawing the rectangles.

Add a mouseClicked() function that updates the relevant variables using the current position of the mouse.

Add the following function, which acts as an abstraction for drawing a monster:

void drawMonster(int x, int y, int width, int height, color fillColor)
{ 
  final int eyeRadius = 5;
 
  fill(fillColor);
  rect(x, y, width, height);

  // Draw the left ear
  triangle(x - width/4, // x1
           y - height/2, // y1
           x - width/4 - 10, // x2
           y - height/2, // y2
           x - width/4 - 5, //x3
           y - height/2 - 10); //y3
 
  // Draw the right ear
  triangle(x + width/4, // x1
           y - height/2, // y1
           x + width/4 + 10, // x2
           y - height/2, // y2
           x + width/4 + 5, //x3
           y - height/2 - 10); //y3
 
  // Draw the left eye
  ellipse(x - width/5,
          y - height/4,
          eyeRadius * 2,
          eyeRadius * 2);
 
 // Draw the right eye
 ellipse(x + width/5,
         y - height/4,
         eyeRadius * 2,
         eyeRadius * 2);
}


Finally, add code to draw() that clears the background and calls the drawMonster() function with the appropriate arguments 
(use the variables you defined at the top of the program).

** QUESTION 3 ** 

Using the drawMonster() function from the previous question, write a program that displays three (unmoving) 
monsters in three different locations. Make sure each monster has a different size and fill colour as well.

(Did you notice that you were able to just copy/paste the drawMonster() function into the new program without 
modifying it? That's because the use of parameters mean the code inside the function is completely self-contained. 
Designing functions this way when possible is a good idea.)
